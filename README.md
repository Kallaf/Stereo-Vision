# Stereo-Vision
In this repository we implement and test some simple stereo algorithms. In each case we take two images Il and Ir (a left and a right image) and compute the horizontal disparity (ie., shift) of pixels along each scanline. This is the so-called baseline stereo case, where the images are taken with a forward-facing camera, and the translation between cameras is along the horizontal axis.
